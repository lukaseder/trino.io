## Lukas Eder and data geekery

Lukas is recognized as a Java Champion and well-known as a very active member of
the Java community. We chat about his history and involvement in the community
of Java and related open source projects, and how it lead to [jOOQ and his
company data geekery](https://www.jooq.org/).

## jOOQ

jOOQ stands for jOOQ Object Oriented Querying (jOOQ). It generates Java code
from your database, and lets you build type safe SQL queries through its
fluent API.

All editions of jOOQ since the 3.19 release include support for Trino. The
level of support depends on the used catalog and connector, and further
Trino-specific enhancements are in progress.

</a>

In our conversation and demo session with Lukas we cover all the following
aspects and a few other topics:

* What is jOOQ?
* What motivated the creation of jOOQ.
* Discuss the great reasons for using jOOQL:
  * Database first
  * Typesafe SQL
  * Code generation
  * Active records
  * Multi-tenancy
  * Standardization
  * Query lifecycle
  * Procedures
* What databases are supported by jOOQ and commonly used?
* Chat about some customer use cases.
* How Lukas discovered Trino and decided to add support for it.
* Challenges and interesting aspects of supporting different databases
* What is next for jOOQ in general, and Trino support specifically?
* Cool SQL features in Trino that might be suitable for standardization:
  * Higher order functions, partially [already supported in jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/doc/dev/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/array-functions/)
  * Integration of object-relational database feature, such as nested
    collections with `ARRAY` or `LIST`.
  * Potential introduction of new concepts to SQL, such as `MAP`.
* Complexities from Trino having different catalogs and connectors, and the
  catalog, schema, table hierarchy.
